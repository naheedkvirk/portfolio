      <p>
        I’m a UI/UX Developer with over 15 years of experience designing and building seamless digital
        interfaces that not only look great but feel intuitive and perform flawlessly. I specialize in
        developing modern, responsive, and accessible front-ends using <strong>Material Design principles</strong> and
        libraries like <strong>Angular Material</strong>, bringing consistency, clarity, and structure to every project.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My work is rooted in a deep understanding of user behavior, design systems, and front-end technologies.
        I’m passionate about building products that solve real problems—balancing aesthetics with functionality and business
        needs with user delight.

      <p>
        With a strong command of component-driven architecture, clean code practices, and scalable UI frameworks,
        I help teams create cohesive design systems that enhance usability and speed up development. Whether collaborating
        with designers, back-end engineers, or product stakeholders, I strive to bring clarity and creativity to every interaction.
